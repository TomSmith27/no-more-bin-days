        <b-card-title>What is a Tetra Pak?</b-card-title>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p></p>
        <p>
          A Tetra Pak is a carton. Tetra Pak is the leading manufacturer, hence why the manufacturer itself has become a household name - a bit like Jacuzzi or Thermos!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tetra Paks are made of multiple layers - 75% paperboard, 20% polyethylene and 5% aluminium - making them great for storing liquid foods. What it makes them not so great at, is being
          recycled. Having all these components makes them tricky to recycle - it's an expensive and energy-intensive process to separate the three materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          Previously most local authorities did not collect Tetra Paks in your household bins and you always had to take them to a collection location yourself. Nowadays though two thirds of local
          authorities do collect Tetra Paks as part of their kerbside recycling - according to the 2017 study by WRAP. However, Sheffield doesn't! There are two collection points for Tetra Paks in
          Sheffield where you can take them to be recycled - find them in the app!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tetra Paks are convenient, light-weight and do contain some useful and tasty products - passata, orange juice, custard, to name a few. But if you want to be more sustainable, then choose
          cans or glass.

        <b-card-title>Terracycle - what is it?</b-card-title>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          Terracycle is a recycling scheme that recycles hard-to-recycle products. Terracycle have teamed up with various companies to create and run these recycling schemes. Many of the Terracycle
          recycling locations have been added to No More Bin Days. Many of the products listed in The Recycle Guide would not be able to be recycled without Terracycle - the crisp packets, sweetie
          wrappers, dental products and more are all recycled through Terracycle schemes.
        </p>
        <p>You can also get involved yourself and set-up a drop off location!</p>

        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>Below you can find three common labels you may find on packaging - have a read and find out what the labels actually mean!</p>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>Widely Recycled</b>
        </p>
        <p>This label is applied to packaging that is collected by 75% or more of local authorities across the UK.</p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <img src="../static/didyouknow/1.PNG" alt />
        </div>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>Check Locally</b>
        </p>
        <p>This label is applied to packaging that is collected by 20-75% of local authorities across the UK.</p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <img src="../static/didyouknow/3.PNG" alt />
        </div>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          Just looking at the symbol on the 'Check Locally' label you could easily think that this packaging cannot be recycled. But think again! Actually your local authority may well collect it and
          if not, you may be able to recycle it at another location - use the Search function on the homepage to see if your packaging can be recycled somewhere.
        </p>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>Not Yet Recycled</b>
        </p>
        <p>This label is applied to packaging when less than 20% of local authorities collect it across the UK, for example crisp packets.</p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center my-2">
          <img src="../static/didyouknow/4.PNG" alt />
        </div>
        <hr class="border-primary" />

        <h4 class>Here are some other labels you may find interesting:</h4>
        <p>This symbol could easily trick you into thinking the packaging is recyclable!</p>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>The Green Dot</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Green Dot does not necessarily mean that the packaging is recyclable, will be recycled or has been recycled. It is a symbol used on packaging in some European countries and signifies
          that the producer has made a financial contribution towards the recovery and recycling of packaging in Europe.
        </p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <img src="../static/didyouknow/5.PNG" alt />
        </div>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>Mobius Loop</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates that an object is capable of being recycled, not that the object has been recycled or will be accepted in all recycling collection systems. Sometimes this symbol is used with
          a percentage figure in the middle to explain that the packaging contains x% of recycled material.
        </p>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <img src="../static/didyouknow/6.PNG" alt />
        </div>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          There's actually loads of packaging that can be recycled at big supermarkets that few people know about! When you take your carrier bags there to be recycled you can also take all the below
          listed items too. That's a lot of plastic!
        </p>
        <hr class="border-primary" />
        <p>
          <b>Recycle with Bags at Larger Stores: Check Locally for Kerbside</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Some plastic films can be recycled at supermarket's carrier bag collection points. Look out for the 'Recycle with carrier bags at larger stores' message on your breakfast cereal, toilet and
          kitchen roll wraps, bread bag, grocery produce, multipack shrink wrap and newspaper and magazine wraps.
